# Covidters

This is a quick project to automated the creation of the CSV files reqired for all Covid19 ters applications. We are still testing and refining the application and our time is limited. Please log any issues on the issue tracker. We are unable to provide much support. We hope this helps all those SME out there struggling to submit their applications.
